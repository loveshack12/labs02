<h1>The World's Best Spaghetti With Fresh Sauce

</h1>
<h2>By Ryan Rhodes

</h2>
<h3>Ingredients

</h3>
<ul>
	<li> 2 Cloves Garlic</li>
	<li> 2 Cups Fresh Cherry Tomatoes</li>
	<li> 4 Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
	<li> 1 Table Spoon of Olive Oil</li>
	<li> 1 Box of Square Spaghetti Noodles (normal will also work)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Heat up a pan to medium heat with olive oil.</li>
	<li>Cut cherry tomotoes into halves.</li>
	<li>Dice the garlic and add to the pan once heated, heat for about 30 second to a minute.</li>
	<li>Once the garlic has been heated up add in the halved tomatoes.</li>
	<li>While the tomatoes are cooking, add your pasta to boiling water and cook to al dente per box.</li>
	<li>Cook until the tomatoes have released all their juice.</li>
	<li>Once the tomatoes are done, add in a few leaves of fresh basil.</li>
	<li>Add the cooked pasta to the pan with some pasta water.</li>
	<li>Mix and enjoy with freshly grated parmesan.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is my favorite recipe as the sauce from fresh tomatoes has a very light taste which I find delicious in the summer months. It is not too overpowering and strong, and is best enjoyed on a nice summer evening with a glass of red wine!</p>
